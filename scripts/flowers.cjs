		some deets: 4:20pm is the start time, but we'll be there through the evening. there should be plenty of drinks and space to hang outside if you feel like lounging.

		the address is 2684 Lacy St. 90031 #109 (map:https://yaytso.art/deets). you can buzz my dad, or call him, and he should let you in. don't ask me to let you in because I'm a dog and will probably mess with you.

		parking is usually plentiful, so no need to stress there. there is also a metro stop super close if you have heard of that thing.

		Lacy Lofts is inhabited by humans who work and live here. the common area with the koi pond and picnic tables always welcome good company, but just treat the space like your own home ðŸŒ¸:)`
