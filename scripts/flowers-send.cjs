don't tell anyone else, but you were actually my favorite person to sniff-- hope to sniff you again soon. anyway, I have your little flower here, don't tell anyone else again, but yours is my favorite-- certainly the prime color palette.

my dad also added some weird tech to it that I don't understand. you can level it up with eggs and its on a chain or something? I'm not sure, you can ask him if you're curious, otherwise enjoy your trippy little blossom ðŸŒ¸
