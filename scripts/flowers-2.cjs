		parking is usually plentiful, so no need to stress there. there is also a metro stop super close if you have heard of that thing.

		Lacy Lofts is inhabited by humans who work and live here. the common area with the koi pond and picnic tables always welcome good company, but just treat the space like your own home ðŸŒ¸:)`
